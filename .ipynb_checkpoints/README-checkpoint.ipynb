    "According to the [Mayo Clinic Website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204#:~:text=Pneumonia%20is%20an%20infection%20that,and%20fungi%2C%20can%20cause%20pneumonia.), \"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.\" \n",

    "The x-ray images used for this analysis were from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou, China. These x-rays were from pediatric patients ranging from ages one to five as part of their routine care. All images that were of low quality or unreadable were removed and reviewed by three expert physicians for AI analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is organized into three folders containing test, training, and validation) images. Within each folder, there are subfolders for each category (Pneumonia/Normal). In total, there are 5,863 X-Ray images. The dataset was downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)."

    "***\n",
    "For the preprocessing stage of this image classification task, I created data generators of training, testing, validation data using the Keras ImageDataGenerator function. I rescaled the images to 1/255. I wanted the pixels for each image to be 128 X 128, so I put that in target_size. I made the class_mode parameter 'binary' since this is a binary problem. I set the batch_size according to the number of images for each test, training, and validation set."

I used classification reports to obtain accuracy, loss, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics for the models. I also built a pretrained VGG19 transfer learning to classify the X-Ray Images. You can learn more about VGG19 classification and detection [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/)."

    "***\n",
    "The best model had an accuracy rate of almost 80%, which is not great, but still pretty good. Most of the models I built had an accuracy of 70% and up. The models most likely need some more hyperparameter tuning and general tuning. My best model struggles with predicting pneumonia images and is more likely to predict false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendations would be to use this model as a first opinion. Then professional doctors would be used as a necessary second opinion to determine whether or not a patient has pneumonia. I would also recommend training these models on adult x-ray images since the images are only of pediatric patients ranging from ages one to five. I think that cropping out visible organs would help the model perform better, if possible."

    "## Future Work\n",
    "***\n",
    "The X-Ray images still have some organs visible in the picture, confusing the model, making it perform poorly. If these organs can be cropped out before being included in the image sets, I think that would help the model perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this image classification, I used 224 X 224 px image sizes initially. This image size made model training EXTREMELY slow. I lowered the image sizes to 128 X 128 px, which improved runtime. I would have liked to use 64 X 64 px or 32 X 32 px with more time. I believe this would significantly enhance runtime and would allow me more time to run other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also like to research other methods of image classification and do some CNN tuning. I believe that some more preprocessing would help improve the model's performance too."
